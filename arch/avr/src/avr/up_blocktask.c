 * Name: up_block_task
 *
 * Description:
 *   The currently executing task at the head of
 *   the ready to run list must be stopped.  Save its context
 *   and move it to the inactive list specified by task_state.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   tcb: Refers to a task in the ready-to-run list (normally
 *     the task at the head of the list).  It most be
 *     stopped, its context saved and moved into one of the
 *     waiting task lists.  It it was the task at the head
 *     of the ready-to-run list, then a context to the new
 *     ready to run task must be performed.
 *   task_state: Specifies which waiting task list should be
 *     hold the blocked task TCB.
